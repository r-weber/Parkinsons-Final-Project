# Parkinsons-Final-Project
## Fall 2017

Written for BIOS 6611 Methods Final Project. We were given a parkinsons data set and permitted to ask then answer whatever statistical question we wished.

Question(s): Does stage of PD at week 0 influence level of improvement at 4 months?

## PD idea exploration:
  1. vidence from the paper suggests that the greatest improvement is seen at the 4 month check after which suervision decreases, possibly explaining the demise of mobility improvement
  2. Makes change variables in performance on various PD mobility tests
  3. contains bootstrapping code for R squared values from many models built
  4. makes density plots of bootstrapped values
  5. makes partial F tests
  
## Stratified Sampling Code:
  1. code written by Github user 'mrdwab'; retrieved Nov 2017
  2. writes functions for stratified sampling of a dataframe
